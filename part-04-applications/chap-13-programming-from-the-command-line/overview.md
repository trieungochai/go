## Introduction
UIs don’t always have to be a web application frontend web page. End users can interact with software through engaging command-line interfaces, as well as by using a command-line interface (`CLI`).

### Reading arguments
Command-line arguments are a fundamental aspect of building versatile and interactive command-line applications. Reading arguments allow developers to make their applications more dynamic and adaptable to user input.

Command-line arguments serve as a means for users to customize the behavior of a program without modifying its source code. By capturing input parameters from the command line, developers can create versatile applications that cater to different use cases and scenarios.

In Go, the os package serves as a straightforward way to access these arguments. The `os.Args` slice provides a convenient way to access command-line arguments. This allows developers to retrieve information such as file paths, configuration parameters, or any other input relevant to the application’s functionality. The ability to read command-line arguments enhances the user experience by making applications more interactive and user-friendly.

Moreover, command-line arguments enable automation and scripting, allowing users to pass inputs programmatically. This flexibility is particularly valuable in scenarios where the same program needs to be executed with different parameters, making it a powerful tool for scripting and automation tasks.

### Using flags to control behavior
The flags package provides a higher-level and more structured approach to reading arguments compared to directly using the os package. Flags simplify the process of parsing and handling command-line input, making it easier for developers to create robust and user-friendly command-line applications.

The flags package allows you to define flags with associated types and default values, making it clear what kind of input a user is expected to provide. It also automatically generates help messages, making your program more self-documenting.

Here’s a brief overview of how the flags package can help in reading and handling command-line arguments:
- <b>Define flags</b>: You can define flags, along with their types and default values. This provides a clear and structured way to specify expected inputs.
- <b>Parse flags</b>: After defining flags, you can parse the command-line arguments. This initializes flag variables with the values provided by a user.
- <b>Access flag values</b>: Once you have parsed the flag values that have been passed in, you can access the defined flags through variables and continue to work with them throughout the application.

Flags allow you to customize the behavior of your program without the need to modify the source code. For example, you can create flags that allow you to toggle behavior based on if a flag value is set. You can also use basic conditional logic pending the values set for certain flags.

### Streaming large amounts of data in and out of your application
In command-line applications, it is crucial to handle large amounts of data efficiently for performance and responsiveness purposes. Often, command-line applications may be a small part of a larger pipeline processing data. Most people are not going to want to sit around typing out a large amount of data, such as a dataset, piece by piece.

Go allows you to stream data to your applications so that you can process information in chunks, rather than all at once.

This allows you to effectively process large amounts of data, reduce memory overhead, and provide better scalability in the future.

When dealing with large amounts of data, it’s often stored in files. This can range from financial CSV files, analysis Excel files, or machine learning datasets.

There are a few main benefits of streaming data with Go:

- <b>Memory efficiency</b>: The program can read and process data line by line, reducing memory consumption, as you then don’t have to read the entire data into memory.
- <b>Real-time analysis</b>: Users can observe a real-time analysis of the results of processing their data.
- <b>Interactive interface</b>: You can enhance the command-line interface so that it accepts dynamic information or displays additional details when processing large amounts of data.

### Exit codes and command line best practices
Exit codes provide a way for command-line applications to communicate their status to the calling application. A well-defined exit code system allows users and the other scripts to understand whether the application executed successfully or encountered an issue when running.

In Go, the os package provides a straightforward way to set exit codes using the `os.Exit` function. Conventionally, an exit code of 0 indicates success, while any non-zero code signals an error.

For example, you can check the status code of the previous exercise and verify the successful status code. To do this, run echo `$?` in the terminal. `$?` is a special shell variable that holds the exit status of the last command that was executed, and the echo command prints it out. You’ll see the 0 exit code printout denoting a successful execution status, and no error. You can manually catch errors in the program and return non-zero code signals to denote errors. You can even create custom exit codes, such as the following:
```go
const (
  ExitCodeSuccess = 0
  ExitCodeInvalidInput = 1
  ExitCodeFileNotFound = 2
)
```
These can easily be used using `os.Exit`, by placing `os.Exit(ExitCodeSuccess)` in successful cases you want to exit, and by using one of the other error codes when you want to exit in certain circumstances.

While using proper exit codes is an important command line best practice, there are a few others to keep in mind:
- <b>Consistent logging</b>: Use meaningful messages to aid troubleshooting.
- <b>Clear usage information</b>: Provide clear and concise usage information, including flags and arguments. Also, some packages allow you to provide example commands. Those should be used to let others see how to use the commands easily.
- <b>Handle help and versioning</b>: Implement flags to display help and version information. This is good for making your application more user-friendly and providing a means to ensure they are on the latest version by checking the version information.
- <b>Graceful termination</b>: Exit codes should be considered and terminated gracefully, ensuring proper cleanup tasks are performed as needed.
