## Introduction
UIs don’t always have to be a web application frontend web page. End users can interact with software through engaging command-line interfaces, as well as by using a command-line interface (`CLI`).

### Reading arguments
Command-line arguments are a fundamental aspect of building versatile and interactive command-line applications. Reading arguments allow developers to make their applications more dynamic and adaptable to user input.

Command-line arguments serve as a means for users to customize the behavior of a program without modifying its source code. By capturing input parameters from the command line, developers can create versatile applications that cater to different use cases and scenarios.

In Go, the os package serves as a straightforward way to access these arguments. The `os.Args` slice provides a convenient way to access command-line arguments. This allows developers to retrieve information such as file paths, configuration parameters, or any other input relevant to the application’s functionality. The ability to read command-line arguments enhances the user experience by making applications more interactive and user-friendly.

Moreover, command-line arguments enable automation and scripting, allowing users to pass inputs programmatically. This flexibility is particularly valuable in scenarios where the same program needs to be executed with different parameters, making it a powerful tool for scripting and automation tasks.
