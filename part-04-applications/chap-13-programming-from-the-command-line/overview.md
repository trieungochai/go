## Introduction
UIs don’t always have to be a web application frontend web page. End users can interact with software through engaging command-line interfaces, as well as by using a command-line interface (`CLI`).

### Reading arguments
Command-line arguments are a fundamental aspect of building versatile and interactive command-line applications. Reading arguments allow developers to make their applications more dynamic and adaptable to user input.

Command-line arguments serve as a means for users to customize the behavior of a program without modifying its source code. By capturing input parameters from the command line, developers can create versatile applications that cater to different use cases and scenarios.

In Go, the os package serves as a straightforward way to access these arguments. The `os.Args` slice provides a convenient way to access command-line arguments. This allows developers to retrieve information such as file paths, configuration parameters, or any other input relevant to the application’s functionality. The ability to read command-line arguments enhances the user experience by making applications more interactive and user-friendly.

Moreover, command-line arguments enable automation and scripting, allowing users to pass inputs programmatically. This flexibility is particularly valuable in scenarios where the same program needs to be executed with different parameters, making it a powerful tool for scripting and automation tasks.

### Using flags to control behavior
The flags package provides a higher-level and more structured approach to reading arguments compared to directly using the os package. Flags simplify the process of parsing and handling command-line input, making it easier for developers to create robust and user-friendly command-line applications.

The flags package allows you to define flags with associated types and default values, making it clear what kind of input a user is expected to provide. It also automatically generates help messages, making your program more self-documenting.

Here’s a brief overview of how the flags package can help in reading and handling command-line arguments:
- <b>Define flags</b>: You can define flags, along with their types and default values. This provides a clear and structured way to specify expected inputs.
- <b>Parse flags</b>: After defining flags, you can parse the command-line arguments. This initializes flag variables with the values provided by a user.
- <b>Access flag values</b>: Once you have parsed the flag values that have been passed in, you can access the defined flags through variables and continue to work with them throughout the application.

Flags allow you to customize the behavior of your program without the need to modify the source code. For example, you can create flags that allow you to toggle behavior based on if a flag value is set. You can also use basic conditional logic pending the values set for certain flags.
