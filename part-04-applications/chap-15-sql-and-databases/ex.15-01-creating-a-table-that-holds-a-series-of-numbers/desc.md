In this exercise, we are going to write a script that is going to create a table called `numbers`, in which we are going to store numbers. These numbers will be inserted at a later time.

Create two columns, Number and Property. The Number column will hold numbers, while the Property column will be Odd or Even when itâ€™s created.

Use the default Postgres database for the connection. The numbers should range from 0 to 99.
