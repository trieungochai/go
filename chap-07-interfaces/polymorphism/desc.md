Go does not do subclassing like other object-oriented languages because Go does not have classes. Subclassing in object-oriented programming is inheriting from one class to another. By doing subclassing, you are inheriting the fields and methods of another class. Go provides a similar behavior through embedding structs and by using polymorphism through interfaces.

One of the advantages of using polymorphism is that it allows the reuse of methods that have been written once and tested. Code is reused by having an Application Programming Interface (API) that accepts an interface; if our type satisfies that interface, it can be passed to that API. There is no need to write additional code for each type; we just need to ensure we meet the interface methodâ€™s set requirements. Obtaining polymorphism through the use of interfaces will increase the reusability of the code. If your API only accepts concrete types such as int, float, and bool, only that concrete type can be passed. However, if your API accepts an interface, then the caller can add the required method sets to satisfy that interface regardless of the underlying type. This reusability is accomplished by allowing your APIs to accept interfaces.
