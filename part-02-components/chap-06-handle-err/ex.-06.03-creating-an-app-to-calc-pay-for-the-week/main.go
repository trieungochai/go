// we are going to create a function that calculates pay for the week.
// This function will accept two arguments â€“ the hours worked during the week and the hourly rate.
// The function is going to check whether the two parameters meet the criteria for being valid.
// The function will need to calculate regular pay, which is hours less than or equal to 40, and overtime pay, which is hours greater than 40 for the week.
// We will create two error values using errors.New().
// The one error value will be used when there is an invalid hourly rate.
// An invalid hourly rate in our app is an hourly rate that is less than 10 or greater than 75.
// The second error value will be when hours per week are not between 0 and 80.
