Closures are a form of anonymous functions. Regular functions cannot reference variables outside of themselves; however, an anonymous function can reference variables external to their definition. A closure can use variables declared at the same level as the anonymous functionâ€™s declaration. These variables do not need to be passed as parameters. The anonymous function has access to these variables when it is called.
