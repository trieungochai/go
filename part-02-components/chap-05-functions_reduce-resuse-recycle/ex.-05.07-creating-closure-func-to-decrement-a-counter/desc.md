We can directly print the result of calling the `decrement` function without assigning it to the `x` variable. However, we would need to call the closure returned by `decrement` directly within `fmt.Println` and avoid storing it in a variable.

### Direct Call Example:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    counter := 4

    // Directly calling the closure returned by decrement
    fmt.Println(decrement(counter)()) // 3
    fmt.Println(decrement(counter)()) // 3 again, because it creates a new closure each time
    fmt.Println(decrement(counter)()) // 3 again, same reason
    fmt.Println(decrement(counter)()) // 3 again
}

func decrement(num int) func() int {
    return func() int {
        num-- // Each call decrements the local 'i'
        return i
    }
}
```

### Explanation:

- **The `decrement(counter)()` line**: Here, `decrement(counter)` returns a closure (a function), and then `()` calls that closure immediately.
- **Result**: Every time we call `decrement(counter)()`, we're creating a **new closure** that starts with the original value of `counter` (which is `4`), and `num` gets decremented within that new closure. Since each closure is separate, the state of `num` does not persist between the calls to `decrement(counter)`.

### Output:

```
3
3
3
3
```

### Keeping the State Across Calls:

If we want to keep the state across multiple calls (i.e., decrement the counter progressively with each call), we **must** store the closure in a variable (like `x`) or use a different mechanism (such as a struct) that holds the state across calls.

#### Example with a variable to maintain state:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    counter := 4
    x := decrement(counter) // Store the closure

    fmt.Println(x()) // 3
    fmt.Println(x()) // 2
    fmt.Println(x()) // 1
    fmt.Println(x()) // 0
}

func decrement(i int) func() int {
    return func() int {
        i-- // Each call decrements the local 'i'
        return i
    }
}
```

### Key Points:
- Without storing the closure in a variable (`x`), each time we call `decrement(counter)()`, we're creating a **new closure** with the initial value of `counter` (in this case, `4`), which results in no state persistence.
- If we want to "keep" the decrements across function calls, we need to keep the closure around (by assigning it to a variable).
